## Car_Price_Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is focused on predicting the prices of used cars using machine learning. Leveraging advanced techniques, it estimates car values based on key features such as brand, model, mileage, and more. The project includes steps from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and deployment with a Streamlit application for easy interaction.
### Requirements
* Python 3.7+
* Required Python libraries: `numpy`,`pandas`,`streamlit`,`matplotlib`,`scikit-learn`,`seaborn`
### Keys Components
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles data cleaning, missing value imputation, and feature scaling to prepare the data for modeling.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creates and selects features that enhance the predictive power of the model.
* **Model Development:** Trained various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Hyperparameter tuning was applied to enhance their performance.
* **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²). The model with the highest R² score and the lowest MSE and MAE was selected for deployment.
* **Deployment:** Provides an interactive Streamlit application for users to input car details and receive price predictions.
